# Sample iOS app - FotoFilter

**Work in progress**

A sample iOS app written in Swift to demonstrate my skills. All the other projects I've worked on have been for my employer. I have no code from those projects to share. The FotoFilter app is nothing earthshaking, but demonstrates my basic proficiency in:

* Swift / iOS development
* Basic UIKit usage, including UINavigationController, UICollectionView, etc.
* Camera and media handling
* CIFilter and image manipulation
* File management
* Share sheet
* CocoaPods use for dependency management
* Realm data storage
* Custom icon font
* Coordinator pattern to address "massive view controllers"
* etc...

Target: iPhone running iOS 12.1, Xcode 10.2, Swift 4

## Running the app

1. Clone or download the source code
2. Run `pod install` to install the dependencies
3. Update the Code Signing details to your credentials
4. Build to a device (since it uses the camera, you need to run on a phone)
